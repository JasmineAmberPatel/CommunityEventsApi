# CommunityEventsApi

An ASP.Net Core minimal web API which is connected to a MongoDB database. The API is tested using Xunit. 

## Running the project:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio then build the application.
3. Once the project is running you can visit http://localhost:5172/swagger/index.html remembering to replace the port number with whichever port you have the application running on. As the API is a minimal API it will open on whichever port is available. Alternatively you can use Postman to test and interact with the API endpoints.
5. Once the API is running you can run the frontend which you can find here: https://github.com/JasmineAmberPatel/CommunityEvents
